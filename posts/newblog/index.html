<p>You may notice that posts have been written before this one. I have ported my posts from <strong>Medium</strong>, as I greatly prefer the customizability and more professional manner of a blog using a static site generator, and I get to write posts in <strong>Markdown</strong> as well.</p>
<p>My previous posts consider <em>reverse engineering minesweeper</em> for a end-product of forcing every cell in a board to contain a mine. If that sounds interesting, check it out.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-this-blog-about">What is this blog about?</h3>
<p>I mainly plan on posting whatever is of interest to me, but expect <strong>graphics programming</strong> and <strong>C++</strong> related posts for the near future.</p>
