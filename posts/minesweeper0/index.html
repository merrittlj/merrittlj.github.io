			<p>Hello readers, and welcome to my first article I’ve wrote and the first in this series. In this series we will be <strong>Reverse Engineering</strong> a basic, old <strong>Windows Minesweeper binary</strong> and <strong>creating custom patches</strong> for our desired functionality.</p>

<h6 id="_this-is-going-to-be-a-fun-series_"><em>This is going to be a fun series.</em></h6>
<h3 id="my-goal-for-this-series"><strong>My goal for this series</strong></h3>
<p>There are <strong>many</strong> different reasons why I’m starting this series. However, in general, besides <strong>having fun</strong>, this is meant to be a <strong>well documented, easy</strong> introduction to <strong>Reverse Engineering binaries</strong> as a whole; and <strong>some</strong> of this knowledge can even be <strong>used outside</strong> of this topic.</p>
<h3 id="needed-resources"><strong>Needed Resources</strong></h3>
<p>As <strong>Reverse Engineering</strong> is pretty complex in general, we will need a couple things to get started, such as:</p>
<h3 id="your-target-program"><strong>Your target program</strong></h3>
<p>For this series, we will use a simple <strong>Windows Minesweeper</strong> binary(found <a href="http://www.minesweeper.info/downloads/WinmineXP.html"><strong>here</strong></a>). We will be <strong>looking through</strong> and <strong>investigating</strong> the multiple functionalities of this program, and then we will <strong>apply patches</strong> to make it do what we desire.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/merrittlj/merrittljblog/raw/main/assets/target.png" alt=""></p>
<h6 id="_our-target-program_"><em>Our target program</em></h6>
<h3 id="your-favorite-reverse-engineering-tool"><strong>Your favorite Reverse Engineering Tool</strong></h3>
<p>There is <strong>many</strong> awesome and incredibly useful programs out there for <strong>Reverse Engineering</strong>, but in this tutorial we will be using <strong><em>Ghidra</em></strong>, and <strong>very useful</strong> and popular tool developed by the <strong><em>NSA</em></strong>. It is <strong>free</strong>, and is seen to many as a <strong>strong competitor to <em>IDA Pro</em>, another(paid) extensive tool</strong>. You can download it <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/merrittlj/merrittljblog/raw/main/assets/ghidra.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="cheat-engine"><strong>Cheat Engine</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Cheat Engine</strong> is useful for many things, mainly some of the features that <strong><em>Ghidra</em> doesn’t have</strong>. With Cheat Engine, if you think some code is doing something, you can easily <strong>test it using breakpoints</strong> and see what certain <strong>variables are</strong> as well, or you could track certain <strong>addresses</strong> and their <strong>value</strong> throughout execution. You can find it <a href="https://www.cheatengine.org/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

<h6 id="_cheat-engine-with-windows-dark-mode_"><em><strong>Cheat Engine</strong> with Windows dark mode.</em></h6>
<h3 id="a-good-understanding-of-how-computers-work-at-a-low-leveland-how-to-operate-one-in-general"><strong>A good understanding of how computers work at a low level(and how to operate one in general)</strong></h3>
<p>This can apply to <strong>many</strong> things. Having a <strong>solid understanding on how things are functioning</strong> greatly <strong>helps readability and flow</strong> when working on a program.</p>
<p>For starters, you should have a <strong>basic understanding of Assembly</strong>, as well as <strong>coding</strong> in general. Keep note, that whilst the <strong>more you have experience</strong> with coding and Assembly <strong>the better off you will be</strong>, but <strong>to get started all you should need is a basic understanding</strong> of syntax and different operations(Such as <strong>mov</strong> or <strong>jmp</strong> in <strong>Assembly</strong>, or <strong>C++ project structure</strong>).</p>
<p>There are <strong>many great places</strong> to learn either coding or Assembly on the World Wide Web, but some good places to look further into are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning Assembly: <a href="http://www.staroceans.org/kernel-and-driver/The.Art.of.Assembly.Language.2nd.Edition.pdf"><strong>The Art of Assembly Language(2nd Edition)</strong></a></li>
<li>Learning C++: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp"><strong>C++ Basics/Reference Guide By W3 Schools</strong></a></li>
<li>Combining your knowledge with both: <a href="https://godbolt.org/"><strong>Godbolt Compiler Explorer</strong></a></li>
<li>Going further with your knowledge: <a href="https://crackmes.one/"><strong>Crackme Practice</strong></a></li>

<h3 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Reverse Engineering is a exciting and challenging topic</strong>, with <strong>many possibilities</strong>. In this series, we are just <strong>touching the surface</strong> and patching a simple binary, but there is <strong>much more for you to learn and do</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>In the next article</strong>, we will be installing <strong><em>Ghidra</em></strong>, and getting it up and running to start our project.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, <a href="https://github.com/merrittlj"><strong><em>merrittlj</em></strong></a></p>
